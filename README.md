Arthritis is one of the most common health issues that people face all over the world.
The goal of the presented work is to classify and categorize hand arthritis stages for patients who are affected by arthritis using machine learning.
Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. Hand osteoarthritis leads to specific structural changes in the joints, such as asymmetric joint space narrowing and osteophytes (bone spurs). 
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease which means that the body's immune system attacks its own tissue, including joints.
Psoriatic arthritis is one of the types of arthritis that affects some people who have psoriasis, a disease that causes red patches of skin topped with silvery scales
The main goal of our work is to develop a computerized method that is capable of determining the structural changes seen in radiography of the hand and to assist practitioners in interpreting radiographic changes and diagnosing the disease
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning method based on a multilayer neural network structure. The network was trained on a dataset containing radiographs of the hands, which consist of normal and abnormal ones.
